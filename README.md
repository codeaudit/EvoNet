# EvoNet
Evolve random projection based neural networks. 
The output of a linear random projection (RP) usually has a Gaussian distribution.  The product of 2 (or more) such RP's has a spiky non-Gaussian distribution.  A vector of such products is point-wise sparse, taking a further RP creates a pattern-wise sparse vector. This is probably a better form to multiply by weights for a neural network.
